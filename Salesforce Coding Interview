There are 6 types of relationships in salesforce
1. Lookup Relationships

Loosely coupled relationship. 
Connect one object to another in a one-to-many fashion.

If parent gets deleted this does not mean the child gets deleted and vice versa.
Standard object record can be on the detail side of a custom object in a lookup relationship.
You can have a maximum of 40 lookups on an object.


2. Master-Detail Relationship

Strongly coupled relationship – meaning if the parent is deleted, so are the child records. (Cascade delete.)
Parent record to control child record attributes, such as sharing and visibility. 

Allow reparenting on the child object will allow to change the parent object records. 
weet spot with master-detail relationships is that you can create roll-up summary fields! 
Note that a single object can have a maximum of two master-detail relationships.
Standard object record cannot be a child.

3. Many-to-Many Relationships
Situation where it is required you have many of one record related to many of another. 
Duplicating the lookup field a number of times on each object is not the best practice and will get very messy.
This is where we should leverage Junction Objects.

Junction Object - 

Instead of lookup we can use junction object.
This object is created by using master detail relation on child objects to parent object.
In junction:
The child here is the junction object. And the two main objects is the master.
There is also an example within 'standard' Salesforce objects with Opportunity Products. 
If you want to assign Products to a certain Salesforce Opportunity, you will need to use the Opportunity Line items object (a junction object).


4. Self Relationship

Let’s say you have a campaign that is a part of a bigger campaign.
Multiple child campaigns relate to the main parent campaign.  (known as a Campaign Hierarchy).
Like a child quote created from a parent quote.
Will learn about campaign heirarchy later.

Salesforce User Management

 User object is likely one of the key standard Salesforce objects.
1. Types of Users in Salesforce
Depending on the Salesforce products you use within your org, there may be internal as well as external users.
Imply two different license types: Salesforce User License and Experience Cloud License.

Salesforce Users License:

Types of Salesforce Licenses

A Salesforce license is fundamentally a concept of authorization, not authentication. 
A license dictates what a user is authorized to access within the Salesforce ecosystem, such as features, products, and objects.
Salesforce licenses are allocated to individual users, giving them access to various Salesforce products and features.

Salesforce Licenses: These are user-specific and provide a baseline level of access to products and features, 
                     which can be further adjusted through profiles, permission sets, and the role hierarchy. 

Salesforce User Licenses vs. Salesforce Feature Licenses

1. Salesforce User Licenses: Almost 24 types
Determine the baseline of the features a user can access.
A user may only have one user license. Examples include Salesforce, Identity, and Platform Starter. 

2. Salesforce Feature Licenses:
Entitle a user to access an additional feature that’s not included with their user license (base edition).
Marketing User, Flow User, Knowledge User, and Service Cloud User etc.

How the access are granted:
Company decides to purchase Salesforce → 
Choose an edition → 
Purchase licenses → 
Assign user licenses to users → 
Assign feature licenses (optional) – access to features that are not included with the base edition. 

3. Salesforce Platform Licenses:

Platform licenses are available in Enterprise and Unlimited editions.
Platform licenses include accounts, contacts, and reports, as well as the automation tools such as
 e.g. Process Builder, Flow, and Apex).

4. Salesforce Identity Licenses
5. Salesforce Einstein Licenses
6. Salesforce Experience Cloud (Community) Licenses
   There are five license types:

   External App
   Customer Community
   Customer Community Plus
   Partner Community
   Channel

7. Salesforce Integration User Licenses

Designed for system-to-system integrations, as it only provides the user with API access.
Simply put, your instance’s functionality or data cannot be accessed through the user interface by users who are assigned this license type.

Step	Topic	Why This Order Matters
1️⃣	Profiles & Permission Sets	Controls object-level and field-level access. Foundation for what users can see/do.
2️⃣	OWD (Organization-Wide Defaults)	Sets record-level access baseline. Defines how broadly records are shared by default.
3️⃣	Role Hierarchy	Opens access vertically (managers see subordinates’ records). Builds on OWD.
4️⃣	Sharing Rules	Opens access horizontally (peer-level sharing). Refines OWD for specific conditions.
5️⃣	Manual Sharing	User-controlled sharing for individual records. Last layer of flexibility.


Salesforce Security Model:
All the above topics fall under security model of the salesforce.

Setup:
Users -> All the security options are present under the Users tab so these all are user specific.

Permission Set Groups

Permission Sets

Profiles

Public Groups

Queues

Roles

User Access Policies

User Management Settings

Users

What are the differences between Salesforce Roles and Profiles?
"Roles see, profiles do".

What is a Salesforce Profile?

Profiles control what users can do in your Salesforce org. This can be referred to as CRED:
C = create
R = read
E = edit
D = delete

System administrator is a profile.

It determines:
Which objects (e.g., Leads, Opportunities, Accounts) the user can access
What actions they can perform on those objects (Create, Read, Edit, Delete — aka CRUD)
Which fields are visible or editable
Which tabs, apps, and page layouts are available
System permissions (e.g., “Modify All Data”, “Run Reports”, “API Access”)
Every Salesforce user must be assigned exactly one profile, which acts as their baseline access configuration.
So to check if the user has the permission to see the object or 
not first go to the Profiles and check under standard or custom object permissions.


"Profiles are designed to group users into functions, for example, ‘Sales’, ‘Support’ etc."

*-----------------------------------------------------------------*
Salesforce license
Standard User License - Salesforce, Platform user and all.
Profiles - Object Crud access - App konse object ke records pr operations perform kr sakte ho. Fields and all. Read/Edit kr sakte ho, records create lr sakte ho and all.

System admin ek profile he:

Wo dene se hum authorization kr rahe he ek user ko ki wo kya kya access kr sakta he, and wo kya kya records pr crud operations kr sakta he.

So its just permission to do work on data table. Or we can say it is a limitation that what all work a user can do on the database data.
*-----------------------------------------------------------------*

For fields -

Field-Level Security	Determines visibility/editability of individual fields.  ( Read and edit access can be controlled on specific fields )
We can either view a field or row in table like department is visible or not.
And we can edit this department field or not - Like Computer science to Mechanical can be assigned or not.

Only Required Fields and master-detail fields on child (Always 'Required' By default.) cant be controlled on field level security in salesforce.
They are always Readable and editable.

What About Permission Sets?

Permission sets could be considered add-ons for profiles.
Profiles are basically a group which has some permissions. A user is assigned this means now whole group has access to those stuff.
But what if a user from this group needs to be given some special access. In that case we provide permission set to that user.

Profiles - Accesses of a group.
Permission Set - Special or add on access to the user assigned to a particular profile.
In order to grant a very specific ability to a user, you obviously don’t want to create a whole new profile.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Sharing Settings:

Profiles control what a user can do in Salesforce (permissions), while Roles control what data a user can see (record visibility).

2️⃣	OWD (Organization-Wide Defaults)	Sets record-level access baseline. Defines how broadly records are shared by default. -- Note: It is set for all the profiles in one go. So it is organisation wide default.

Now we can control the record visibility as well in the salesforce. But why?
We want to control the security of the records the users "dont own".
OWD is a key part of Salesforce’s "record-level" security model.

Why It’s Needed:

Protect sensitive data: Prevent users from seeing or editing records they shouldn’t.

Establish minimum access: Define what the most restricted user can see or do.

Enable layered sharing: Acts as the foundation for more advanced sharing mechanisms like roles, sharing rules, and teams.

Access Level	Description:
Private	Users can only see records they own.
Public Read Only	Users can view all records but only edit their own.
Public Read/Write	Users can view and edit all records.
Controlled by Parent	Access is determined by the parent object (used for child relationships).
Can configure OWD for both standard objects (like Account, Opportunity) and custom objects.

Yes, in Salesforce, objects that are part of a Master-Detail relationship automatically have their 
Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD) set to “Controlled by Parent".

When an object is a detail in a Master-Detail relationship:
Its record-level access is inherited from the master (parent) object.
You cannot set OWD manually for the detail object — Salesforce disables that option.

Kyuki master pr access nai hua to child me master object ki field error degi. Ki master kaha he!

1 On Course object I gave all the access on profile to perform cred on the object so one can do all the operations on the records present.
2 Now in owd I made the access to Private on Course Object. Means I can't see other users records. Hence I cant do crud on their records.
So in 1 I can do what operations on course object is mentioned but in 2 I can do those operations on which records is mentioned.

In Public I can see others records but cant do anything else. Buttons are showing to edit but we can't.

So, basically OWD is for accessing others records.
Now I have set other can just see my records but cant do anything else on those.

But now i want to open this security a bit.
I want my manager can access these records and edit them as well. So I am going to use roles for this. 
Opening my records access vertically.

Roles ---------

Think of roles as vertical access control: They determine who can see data owned by whom.
They work in tandem with OWD (Organization-Wide Defaults) to open up access upward in the hierarchy.

CEO
└── VP of Sales
    └── Regional Manager
        └── Sales Rep

If OWD is Private, a Sales Rep can only see their own records.
But the Regional Manager, VP, and CEO can see the Sales Rep’s records because they are higher in the role hierarchy.

By default the ones above in the heirarchy, can see, edit and delete the records of the
ones below them in the case when the OWD of that object is set to private. Not the ones in parallel.
They cant see the records of someone in parallel.

----------------------------------------------------+ Understood roles now

Now if I wish to open my records horizontally.

4️⃣	Sharing Rules	Opens access horizontally (peer-level sharing). Refines OWD for specific conditions.

Sharing Rules are automated rules that grant additional access to records based on:

(Types)
a. Who owns the record (owner-based sharing) -- Share all records owned by “Sales Reps” with “Sales Managers”
b. What the record contains (criteria-based sharing) -- Share all Accounts where Industry = Healthcare with “Healthcare Team”

Why Use Sharing Rules?

a. OWD sets the baseline (e.g., Private), but Sharing Rules let you open up access.
b. They’re essential when users need access to records they don’t own.
c. You can share with roles, public groups, or territories.


On same page : Sharing settings 

We have option to create a sharing rule.

🧱 Example Use Case
You set Case OWD to Private. You create a criteria-based sharing rule to share all Cases with Priority = High to the Support Escalation Team.

Went to sharing settings page having both OWD and Sharing rules:
Added a new rule on Owner based sharing.
---------------------------------------------+

Manual Sharing ---------

Note:

✅ 3. Lightning Experience Limitation
In Lightning, the "Sharing" button is not shown by default.
You need to add it manually to the page layout.
Only the record owner or users above the owner in the role hierarchy can manually share a record.
If the user doesn’t own the record, they won’t see the button — even if they have read/write access.
I created a records as svp of marketing and sales and shared it with the vp of sales who is lower in the heirarchy by clicking on the sharing button of the dropdown.
To send the record manually to other roles, you need to give view all permission set in system settings to the user or any other way. Need to check.

Configuring Field-Level Security:

There are multiple ways from which you can control field-level access inside Salesforce.

Profiles
Permission Set
Page layout
Lightning Record page (Dynamic Form)

We have seen from profiles we can control the field visibility. As making that read only and editable.
Same can be done from the permission set in the object settings for particular user.

Now lets see from page layouts:

With the help of page layout in Salesforce, we can make a field read-only, or required.
We can make field readonly for any particular profile while creating that field as well.

Go to object -> page layouts -> edit -> click on wrench -> you can make it readonly or required.

Even on fields on objects you can set the field level security as
🔲 Visible	 🔲 Read-Only to any particular profile

So 2 places to check the field level security:

1. On objects field - If for any profile it is set as readonly or visibility is off.
2. On Page layout - for readonly and required or not.

Why Read-Only Fields Are Editable for System Admins
✅ 1. System Admins Bypass Field-Level Security
The System Administrator profile has “Modify All Data” and “Customize Application” permissions.
These permissions allow admins to override field-level security, including read-only settings on page layouts.

So general steps on field are ----------------------

While creating the field I can set:

1. Required on the creation page, whether its necessary or not. If not then i'll leave it. (Once made it required you cannot set it to readonly or not required on page layout).
Also if made required you cannot set the visible or readonly for profiles on the creartion page. It is set to visible for all the profiles by default and can set readonly and both are disabled.

Now once this field is created we can set who can see it or which profiles can see it. 
And once visible we can also set if any profile can just have a read access only (🔲 Visible	 🔲 Read-Only). This is the first point to set the read access or visibility.

Now if in future any new profile is created then I can set these things like visibility and readonly access on that profile as well.
Field level security on field creation page and on profile page are interconnected. You can set this security on any page and it works fine.
Both are interconnected. You change on one page and it reflects on the other page.

2. Visible for any profile or not. If visible:
3. Readonly for that profile or not.
+----------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Salesforce Page Layouts

You can create page layouts and even edit the assignments to the specific profiles like a particular profile can 
see only a particular page layout.

So the assignment is profile wise.

Ok now I created a page layout created sections in it.
Actions tab is the right side of the Highlights panel.
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Record types:

I created two record types for techincal and non technoical courses in the course objects picklist. 
Then assign these to 2 different record types to 2 different layouts. 
And when you create a new record we get a pop up to choose the record type data to create for.
It is used to segregate the picklists for different records.

Data Management and Security

1. Data Import and Export Tools
 a. Data Loader
 b. Dataloader.io
 c. Data Import Wizard

a. Data Loader : 

The 6 Best Data Loaders for Salesforce (Pros & Cons)

Data Import Wizard - 

Maximum of 50,000 records at a time, can only import data, experienced users may find the lack of settings frustrating.

Under this Integrations tab we get this:

API
> API Catalog
Basic Data Import
Change Data Capture
Data Import Wizard
Data Loader
Dataloader.io
External Data Sources
External Objects
External Services
Platform Events
Teams Integration

Salesforce Data Loader - 
It allows you to insert, update, upsert, delete, and export.
You also get an increase from 50,000 max records with the import wizard, to 5,000,000.

dataloader.io

It is 100% cloud-based and accessed through your browser.
Ability to schedule tasks, and secondly, dataloader.io can automatically find parent records based on text, not an ID, pretty much carrying out the VLookup for you.

Salesforce Automation Tools:

Workflow Rules: 

What Workflow Rules Are
Definition: Workflow Rules are instructions that tell Salesforce to automatically perform actions when records meet defined criteria.
Purpose: They help reduce manual work by automating repetitive tasks such as notifications, updates, and assignments.
Scope: Can be applied to standard and custom objects.

Key Components: 

Evaluation Criteria
Decide when the rule runs (e.g., when a record is created, edited, or meets certain conditions).
Options include:
Created
Created and every time it’s edited
Created and edited to meet criteria

Rule Criteria

Logical conditions that determine if the workflow should fire (e.g., Status = 'Closed Won').

Actions

Immediate Actions: Triggered right away (e.g., send an email, update a field).
Time-Dependent Actions: Triggered at a scheduled time after the rule criteria are met (e.g., send a reminder email 7 days later).


Types of Workflow Actions - 

Field Update → Automatically change values in fields.
Email Alert → Send notifications using templates.
Task Creation → Assign tasks to users.
Outbound Message → Send data to external systems via SOAP messages.


Example Use Cases
Send an email to the Account Owner when a new high-value Opportunity is created.
Update the Status field to “Follow-Up” when a Case is reopened.
Create a task for a Sales Rep when a Lead’s rating changes to “Hot.”

Limits & Transition
Limits: Workflow Rules cannot update related records or perform complex branching logic.
Transition: Salesforce is moving towards Flows and Process Builder for more advanced automation. Workflow Rules are still supported but considered legacy automation

✅ In short: Workflow Rules are simple, rule-based automations in Salesforce that trigger actions when records meet defined criteria. 
They’re great for straightforward tasks but are being phased out in favor of Flows, which offer more flexibility and power.


You can update any field according to a condition using worklow rules other than Triggers.


Process Builder:

What Process Builder Is
Definition: A visual automation tool that allows admins to build processes using a flowchart‑style interface.
Purpose: Automates complex business processes without writing Apex code.
Status: Still supported, but Salesforce recommends migrating to Flows for future‑proof automation.
