There are 6 types of relationships in salesforce
1. Lookup Relationships

Loosely coupled relationship. 
Connect one object to another in a one-to-many fashion.

If parent gets deleted this does not mean the child gets deleted and vice versa.
Standard object record can be on the detail side of a custom object in a lookup relationship.
You can have a maximum of 40 lookups on an object.


2. Master-Detail Relationship

Strongly coupled relationship – meaning if the parent is deleted, so are the child records. (Cascade delete.)
Parent record to control child record attributes, such as sharing and visibility. 

Allow reparenting on the child object will allow to change the parent object records. 
weet spot with master-detail relationships is that you can create roll-up summary fields! 
Note that a single object can have a maximum of two master-detail relationships.
Standard object record cannot be a child.

3. Many-to-Many Relationships
Situation where it is required you have many of one record related to many of another. 
Duplicating the lookup field a number of times on each object is not the best practice and will get very messy.
This is where we should leverage Junction Objects.

Junction Object - 

Instead of lookup we can use junction object.
This object is created by using master detail relation on child objects to parent object.
In junction:
The child here is the junction object. And the two main objects is the master.
There is also an example within 'standard' Salesforce objects with Opportunity Products. 
If you want to assign Products to a certain Salesforce Opportunity, you will need to use the Opportunity Line items object (a junction object).


4. Self Relationship

Let’s say you have a campaign that is a part of a bigger campaign.
Multiple child campaigns relate to the main parent campaign.  (known as a Campaign Hierarchy).
Like a child quote created from a parent quote.
Will learn about campaign heirarchy later.
