There are 6 types of relationships in salesforce
1. Lookup Relationships

Loosely coupled relationship. 
Connect one object to another in a one-to-many fashion.

If parent gets deleted this does not mean the child gets deleted and vice versa.
Standard object record can be on the detail side of a custom object in a lookup relationship.
You can have a maximum of 40 lookups on an object.


2. Master-Detail Relationship

Strongly coupled relationship – meaning if the parent is deleted, so are the child records. (Cascade delete.)
Parent record to control child record attributes, such as sharing and visibility. 

Allow reparenting on the child object will allow to change the parent object records. 
weet spot with master-detail relationships is that you can create roll-up summary fields! 
Note that a single object can have a maximum of two master-detail relationships.
Standard object record cannot be a child.

3. Many-to-Many Relationships
Situation where it is required you have many of one record related to many of another. 
Duplicating the lookup field a number of times on each object is not the best practice and will get very messy.
This is where we should leverage Junction Objects.

Junction Object - 

Instead of lookup we can use junction object.
This object is created by using master detail relation on child objects to parent object.
In junction:
The child here is the junction object. And the two main objects is the master.
There is also an example within 'standard' Salesforce objects with Opportunity Products. 
If you want to assign Products to a certain Salesforce Opportunity, you will need to use the Opportunity Line items object (a junction object).


4. Self Relationship

Let’s say you have a campaign that is a part of a bigger campaign.
Multiple child campaigns relate to the main parent campaign.  (known as a Campaign Hierarchy).
Like a child quote created from a parent quote.
Will learn about campaign heirarchy later.

Salesforce User Management

 User object is likely one of the key standard Salesforce objects.
1. Types of Users in Salesforce
Depending on the Salesforce products you use within your org, there may be internal as well as external users.
Imply two different license types: Salesforce User License and Experience Cloud License.

Salesforce Users License:

Types of Salesforce Licenses

A Salesforce license is fundamentally a concept of authorization, not authentication. 
A license dictates what a user is authorized to access within the Salesforce ecosystem, such as features, products, and objects.
Salesforce licenses are allocated to individual users, giving them access to various Salesforce products and features.

Salesforce Licenses: These are user-specific and provide a baseline level of access to products and features, 
                     which can be further adjusted through profiles, permission sets, and the role hierarchy. 

Salesforce User Licenses vs. Salesforce Feature Licenses

1. Salesforce User Licenses: Almost 24 types
Determine the baseline of the features a user can access.
A user may only have one user license. Examples include Salesforce, Identity, and Platform Starter. 

2. Salesforce Feature Licenses:
Entitle a user to access an additional feature that’s not included with their user license (base edition).
Marketing User, Flow User, Knowledge User, and Service Cloud User etc.

How the access are granted:
Company decides to purchase Salesforce → 
Choose an edition → 
Purchase licenses → 
Assign user licenses to users → 
Assign feature licenses (optional) – access to features that are not included with the base edition. 

3. Salesforce Platform Licenses:

Platform licenses are available in Enterprise and Unlimited editions.
Platform licenses include accounts, contacts, and reports, as well as the automation tools such as
 e.g. Process Builder, Flow, and Apex).

4. Salesforce Identity Licenses
